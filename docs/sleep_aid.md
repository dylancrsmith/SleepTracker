# Sleep Aid

## What It Does

Sleep Aid adds a non-medical wind-down module with:

- Guided wind-down checklist (progress + XP reward)
- Offline calming audio player (loop, timer, volume)
- Guided breathing (4s inhale, 4s hold, 6s exhale)
- Smart bedtime reminder prompt and optional local reminder scheduling
- Light stretching guide
- 5-minute relaxation/body scan text guide with optional timer

## Privacy Stance

- Sleep Aid is designed for local use.
- Audio is bundled offline in app assets.
- No microphone recording is used.
- No user audio is captured or stored.
- Reminder scheduling uses local device notifications only (no cloud services).

## Habit Loop Support (Cue -> Routine -> Reward)

- Cue: Bedtime reminder prompt based on stored bedtime settings.
- Routine: Wind-down checklist, breathing, stretches, and relaxation flow.
- Reward: XP is granted when the full wind-down checklist is completed (once per day).
